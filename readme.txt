This project contains three programs that use suplimental components. Use the command 'make all' to compile all parts of the program. Individual compiling instructions are provided below.

---keygen---
To compile: make keygen
To run: ./keygen <prime number> <prime number> <public key textfile> <private key textfile>
Description:
The program takes two prime numbers as parameters, if they are less than 100,000 they are checked to verify that they are prime. If not the user is informed. The prime numbers are put into an Euclid formula to generate two keys (a public and a private) and write them appropriately into the textfiles given in the command line. The program uses the ReallyLongInt object from ReallyLongInt.cc

---encrypt---
To compile: make encrypt
To run: ./encrypt <public key textfile> <input textfile> <encrypted textfile>
Description:
The program takes the public key generated by keygen from the public key textfile and uses modPower to encrypt the ASCII values of each character in the input textfile. It then writes the value into the encrypted textfile. The program uses the ReallyLongInt object from ReallyLongInt.cc

---decrypt---
To compile: make decrypt
To run: ./decrypt <private key textfile> <encrypted textfile> <decrypted textfile>
Description:
The program takes the private key from the textfile and uses modPower to decrypt the value from the encrypted file into an ASCII value. Then the ASCII value is converted into a character and written into the decrypted textfile. The program uses the ReallyLongInt object from ReallyLongInt.cc

---ReallyLongInt.cc---
To compile: make ReallyLongInt.o
To run: N/A
Description:
This program contains the class for the ReallyLongInt object, which utilizes Arrays to make an integer with an upper size limit far greater than the normal integer types. It contains the functionality to create, print, and work mathematically with the ReallyLongInt type. 

Known issues:

- In the = operator there is a memory leak as this->digits is dereferenced before being deleted.

---ReallyLongInt.h---
To compile: N/A
To run: N/A
Description:
The header file for ReallyLongInt.cc, declares all the methods.

---numberTheory.h---
To compile: N/A
To run: N/A
Description:
Contains templates for functions used in encrypt.cc, decrypt.cc, and keygen.cc
